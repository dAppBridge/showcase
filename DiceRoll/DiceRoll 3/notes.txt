---------------
bet against anything using Ether
is tomorrow going to rain?
is England going to score 2 against?
That the price of BTC will be higher than 6000USD this time tomorrow....


1. Needs predefined set of INPUTS to bet against -> these can be in an offline DB as well as in the contract
2. The offline DB will be used for the website to show available/upcoming bets
Example:
https://openweathermap.org/history

I bet you that the avg temp in London tomorrow will be higher than 23c.  1eth.
Calculate Odds??? just winner takes all - mins our 4% fee??

OR

default odds to 1/1 and let bet placer select odds: 2/1, 3/1, 4/1, 5/1, 10/1, 50/1, 100/1 etc.

The bet taker then only needs to place a fraction of the bet maker stake

E.g.

I bet that the avg. temp in London tomorrow will be higher than 23c. 1eth at 2/1.

Bet taker then can take this bet for 0.5eth.... can this be split???  so 5 takers of 0.1? 
YES= Each one then gets a 1/5 of the total pot (After our cut)


If higher than 23c => bet maker wins 0.5eth - 4% fee.
If <=23c then bet taker wins 1eth - 4% fee.
